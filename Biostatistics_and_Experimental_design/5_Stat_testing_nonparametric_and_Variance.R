# 1. One sample problem [R+]

# During a study the blood cholesterol (in mg/dL) of men in their thirties who consume high amounts of processed foods was measured.
# cholesterol = 163; 145; 175; 147; 136; 151; 166; 162; 187
# Assume the sample to satisfy a continuous distribution, which is symmetrical around the median. By using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for a median and a significance level of Î± = 0.05 determine the following points:

# [1.5P] a.
# Assess if the median cholesterol level differs significantly from m0 = 145 (the cholesterol level of a healthy male). Use the given formulas (test statistics W+ and critical region K) and the Wilcoxon-table from the homepage to solve this task. Do not use a predefined R-function. The calculations (using the given formulas), however, can be done in R or on paper. State your conclusions by referring to your calculated test statistics and the critical region.

# b) [1P] b.
# Assess if the median cholesterol level is i) less than m0 = 145 and ii) greater than m0 = 145. Solve this task by using the predefined R-function wilcox.test(). State your hypotheses and results for both cases. For your conclusions, refer to your calculated test statistics and the p-values (which are computed by the R-function).

# i) less than m0 = 145

  # Hypotheses
  # H0: m=m0 (The median cholesterol level is equal to the cholesterol level of a healthy male) 
  # H1: m!=m0 (The median cholesterol level is not equal to the cholesterol level of a healthy male) 

chol_m<- c(163, 145, 175, 147, 136, 151, 166, 162, 187)

wilcox.test(chol_m,  var.equal = FALSE)

wilcox.test(chol_m, alternative = "less", var.equal = FALSE)

# ii) greater than m0 = 145.
wilcox.test(chol_m, alternative = "greater", var.equal = FALSE)

# [0.5P] c.
# Summarize your results based on the three hypotheses tested in a. and b.
# Which conclusion can you draw regarding the measured cholesterol level of men who consume a lot of processed food in comparison to the cholesterol level of a healthy male?

#2) Two sample problem [R+]

# To assess the contribution of age on the blood cholesterol levels, the blood cholesterol of two different age groups (A = thirties, B = sixties) with similar diets was measured. Assume that the samples of the two groups are independent and satisfy a continuous distribution, which is symmetrical around the median.
# A = 160; 171; 153; 151; 175; 159; 158; 154; 165
# B = 162; 176; 183; 185; 157; 167; 164; 175; 153
# By using a non-parametric test and a significance level of Î± = 0.05 determine the following points:

# [1.5P] a.
# Assess if there is a difference in the median of the two age groups (A and B), using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Solve this task by using the given formulas (critical region K and test statistic WN) and tables from the homepage and not by using a predefined R-function. The calculations can be done in R or on paper. In addition, insert a table containing the combined and sorted ranks.

# [1P] b.
# Determine if the median cholesterol level of age group A (= in their thirties) is i) greater or ii) less than the cholesterol level of age group B (= in their sixties) using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Solve this task by using the given formulas and tables on the homepage and not by using a predefined R function. Calculations can be done in R or on paper.

# [1P] c.
# Check your results of 2a. by using the R-function wilcox.test(), which computes the Mann-Whitney-U-test statistic (not WN but you can convert using the given formulas!).

#Man Withney U - Test

  # Hypotheses
  # H0: ma=mb (The median of group A and B are equal)
  # H1: ma!=mb (The median of group A and B are not equal)

# 3. Analysis of Variance [R]

# During a study, participants tried losing weight with one of three diets. Their weight at the beginning, and after 6 weeks of sticking to the diet were measured [1], and the amount of lost weight was calculated.
# D1 = 3.8; 4.0; 0.7; 2.9; 2.8; 2.0; 2.0; 8.5; 1.9; 3.1; 1.5; 3.0; 3.6; 0.9
# D2 = 2.1; 2.0; 1.7; 4.3; 6.0; 0.6; 2.7; 3.6; 3.0; 2.0; 2.2; 1.7; 3.3; 0.5
# D3 = 7.0; 5.6; 6.4; 6.8; 7.8; 8.4; 6.8; 7.2; 7.0; 7.3; 9.5; 7.6; 6.1; 6.3
# The success of the three diets should be analysed, using ANOVA. For the following tasks, assume the samples to be normally distributed.

# [2P] a.
# Investigate if the three diets show a difference in the overall amount of lost weight based on ANOVA testing. State your null and alternative hypothesis. Use the given formula to calculate the F-value. Verify your results by using the R-function aov() (for more information on the function use ?aov). Include the summary table of aov in your report (Hint: Use the command summary()). What can you conclude from the test results?

  # Hypotheses
  # H0: Âµ1=Âµ2=Âµ3 (The three samples come from populations with equal mean)
  # H1: Âµ1=Âµ2!=Âµ3; Âµ1!=Âµ2=Âµ3; Âµ1!=Âµ2!=Âµ3 (at least one mean of the three samples differs from the others)
